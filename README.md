# Job Application Tracking(ish) App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It is a simple SPA, used to get me acquianted with NextJS and Typescript; intended to keep a todo list and details of job applications. 

It keeps data in 'localStorage' in your browser, so there is very limited data persistence.

## To run

Just run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```
**NOTE:** Since this project is still in development, the npm 'start' script runs the same script as 'dev'.

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
**NOTE:** As of last week, there's a bug/error expected to be patched in a newer NextJS release (noted in appropriate file/code).
